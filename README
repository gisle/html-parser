HTML-Parser
-----------

This is a collection of modules that parse HTML text documents. These
modules used to be part of the libwww-perl distribution, but are now
unbundled in order to facilitate a separate development track.  Bug
reports and discussions about these modules can still be sent to the
<libwww@perl.org> mailing list.  Remember to also take a look at the
HTML-Tree module collection that create and extract information from
HTML syntax trees.

The modules present in this collection are:

  HTML::Parser - The parser base class.  It receives arbitrary sized
        chunks of the HTML text and will tokenize it by calling
        appropriate methods on itself.

  HTML::Entities - Provides functions to encode and decode text with
        embedded HTML &lt;entities&gt;.

  HTML::Filter - An HTML::Parser subclass that filters HTML text. You
        will need to make a subclass if you want it to do more than
        cat(1).

  HTML::HeadParser - A lightweight HTML::Parser subclass that extract
        information from the <HEAD> section of an HTML document.

  HTML::LinkExtor - An HTML::Parser subclass that extract links from
        an HTML document.

  HTML::TokeParser - An alternative interface to the basic parser
        that does not require subclassing.  Most simple parsing needs
        are probably best attacked with this module.
